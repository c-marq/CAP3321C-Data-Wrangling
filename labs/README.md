## How Labs Work

1. **Open the starter notebook** in Google Colab
2. **Save a copy** to your Google Drive immediately
3. **Complete all tasks** following the instructions in the notebook
4. **Run all cells** before submitting (Runtime → Run all)
5. **Download** your completed notebook (File → Download → Download .ipynb)
6. **Submit** the `.ipynb` file to Canvas before the deadline

## Submission Checklist

Before submitting, verify:

- [ ] Your name is in the first cell of the notebook
- [ ] All code cells have been run (output is visible)
- [ ] All tasks are attempted
- [ ] File is downloaded as `.ipynb` format

## Academic Integrity

Labs are **individual work**. You may:
- ✅ Reference the chapter reading and demo notebook
- ✅ Use the resources in this repository
- ✅ Ask clarifying questions in Canvas discussions
- ✅ Discuss general approaches with classmates

You may **not**:
- ❌ Copy code from classmates
- ❌ Share your solutions with others
- ❌ Use AI to generate solutions without understanding them

## Getting Help

If you're stuck:
1. Re-read the relevant section of the chapter reading
2. Review the demo notebook for similar examples
3. Check Canvas discussions for hints
4. Come to office hours
