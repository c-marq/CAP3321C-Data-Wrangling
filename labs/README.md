## Academic Integrity

Labs are **individual work**. You may:
- ✅ Reference the chapter reading and demo notebook
- ✅ Use the resources in this repository
- ✅ Ask clarifying questions in Canvas discussions
- ✅ Discuss general approaches with classmates

You may **not**:
- ❌ Copy code from classmates
- ❌ Share your solutions with others
- ❌ Use AI to generate solutions without understanding them

## Getting Help

If you're stuck:
1. Re-read the relevant section of the chapter reading
2. Review the demo notebook for similar examples
3. Check Canvas discussions for hints
4. Come to office hours
