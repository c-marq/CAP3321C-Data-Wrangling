## General Guidelines

### Data files supplied by your instructor
- Each lab uses a data file (usually CSV). Your instructor will provide these files.

### Notebooks created by you
- Create one Google Colab notebook per lab.
- Name notebooks using your instructor's convention or `first_last_lab_X-X`.
- Import required modules at the start.
- Use separate code cells for each task/question.
- Add comments to explain your thinking and complex code.
- Use Markdown cells for headings and organization.
