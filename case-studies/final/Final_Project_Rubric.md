## Grading Criteria

| Category | Points | Excellent | Good | Needs Work |
|----------|:------:|-----------|------|------------|
| **Data Cleaning & Preparation** | 40 | **36–40:** All relevant cleaning steps are performed and clearly justified. Missing values, data types, and inconsistencies are handled appropriately. Cleaning rationale is thoroughly explained in Markdown cells. Code runs without errors. | **28–35:** Most cleaning steps are performed correctly. Minor issues remain (e.g., one data type unconverted, incomplete explanation of a cleaning decision). Code runs with minimal warnings. | **0–27:** Significant data quality issues are left unaddressed. Little or no explanation of cleaning decisions. Code contains errors that affect downstream analysis. |
| **Analysis & Visualizations** | 50 | **45–50:** All questions from the assigned section are answered with appropriate tables or plots. Visualizations are well-chosen for the data, clearly labeled (titles, axes, legends), and easy to interpret. Analysis demonstrates strong command of course skills. | **35–44:** Most questions are answered correctly. Visualizations are generally appropriate but may have minor labeling issues or a less-than-optimal chart type choice. Analysis is mostly sound. | **0–34:** Several questions are unanswered or answered incorrectly. Visualizations are missing, mislabeled, or inappropriate for the data. Analysis shows limited application of course skills. |
| **Interpretation & Written Summaries** | 30 | **27–30:** Every question includes a clear, thoughtful written summary that demonstrates understanding of what the results mean. Observations go beyond restating numbers — they provide insight and context. | **21–26:** Most questions include written summaries. Interpretations are generally correct but may be surface-level or simply restate the output without deeper insight. | **0–20:** Written summaries are missing for most questions or are too vague to demonstrate understanding. Little evidence that the student interpreted the results. |
| **Code Quality & Organization** | 25 | **23–25:** Notebook is well-organized with clear Markdown headings and logical flow. Code is clean, commented where needed, uses meaningful variable names, and runs top-to-bottom without errors. No leftover or unnecessary code. | **17–22:** Notebook is mostly organized. Code runs but may have minor issues: inconsistent formatting, sparse comments, or a few unused cells. Overall structure is followable. | **0–16:** Notebook is disorganized or difficult to follow. Code does not run cleanly, has significant errors, or lacks structure. Headings and Markdown cells are missing or misused. |
| **Presentation of Findings** | 35 | **32–35:** Presentation is clear, well-organized, and stays within the 10-minute limit. Both partners participate in the delivery. Key findings are communicated effectively with references to visualizations. Presenters demonstrate strong understanding of their analysis. | **24–31:** Presentation covers the main findings and both partners participate, though delivery may be uneven. Some findings could be explained more clearly. Stays roughly within the time limit. | **0–23:** Presentation is disorganized, significantly over or under time, or only one partner presents. Key findings are unclear or not supported by the analysis. Limited evidence of understanding. |
| **Collaboration & Formatting** | 20 | **18–20:** All submission guidelines are followed: header is complete, file is named correctly, partner and section responsibilities are clearly identified. Both partners contributed meaningfully. | **14–17:** Most guidelines are followed. Minor issues such as an incomplete header field or slightly incorrect filename. Both partners appear to have contributed. | **0–13:** Multiple submission guidelines are not followed. Header is incomplete or missing. Filename does not follow the convention. Unclear whether both partners contributed. |

## Presentation Guidelines

- Presentations should be **10 minutes maximum**. Both partners must participate in the delivery, but the split does not need to be equal — as long as both contribute meaningfully.
- You may present using your Notebook directly (scrolling through code and output) or prepare a few summary slides — whichever best communicates your findings.
- Focus on **what you found**, not just **what you did**. Walk the audience through your key insights, not every line of code.
