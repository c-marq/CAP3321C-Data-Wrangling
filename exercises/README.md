## How Group Exercises Work

1. **Form your group** — Groups are assigned in class
2. **Open the starter notebook** — One person can share their screen, or everyone opens it
3. **Work together** — Discuss approaches, help each other debug
4. **Submit in Canvas** — One submission per group, include all member names

## Grading

Group exercises are graded on:
- **Completion** — Did you attempt all tasks?
- **Correctness** — Do your solutions produce the expected output?
- **Collaboration** — Did everyone contribute?

See the rubric in Canvas for point breakdown.
