## How to Use Solutions

1. **First, complete your own work** and submit it
2. **Compare your approach** to the solution
3. **Note differences** — there's often more than one correct way
4. **Learn from mistakes** — understand why certain approaches work better
5. **Ask questions** — if you don't understand the solution, ask in class or office hours
